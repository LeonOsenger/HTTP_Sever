# HTTP_Sever
A project of a small and simple HTTP Server for training purposes

The end Result of this project should ideally function like a normal HTTP-Server, but in the end the focus should be on learning, and just trying out new stuff. So if this is achieved, the functionality and quality of the project doesnâ€™t matter much (so its probablly gonna be shit).
